'''A program  for GCGB and GCB.
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''This program communicates between a PIC using software I2C and a PICAXE using I2C.
'''The PICAXE is connected via I2C bus with suitable pullup resistors. The I2C Slave address is 0x60. The frequency of the PICAXE is critical.
'''
'''The PICAXE Master sends a value to the Slave and the Slave returns the value with 1 added to it.
'''
'''The PICAXE Master I2C bus is 25khz.  Any faster and communications may fail.
