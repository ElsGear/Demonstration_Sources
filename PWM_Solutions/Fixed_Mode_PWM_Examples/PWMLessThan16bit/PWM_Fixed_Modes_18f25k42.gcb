'''A program  for GCGB and GCB.
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''This program shows how to use Fixed Mode PWM for CCP/PWM and PWM modules - therefore both PWM in this chip.
'''
'''We will set up CCP/PWM on PortB ports - examine with a scope.
'''We will also set up PWM on the PWM module on the PortA ports - also, examine with a scope.
'''
'''An important note is that timer 2 is ALWAYS used by CCP/PWM and therefore CCP/PWM is dependent on timer 2 PWM module.
'''Therefore, f you set #define PWM_Timer2_Freq then will be the frequency of CCP/PWM
